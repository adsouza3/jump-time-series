# Getting started

After cloning the repository: 
### `nvm use`
### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

# Or don't bother installing

### `https://jump-time-series.vercel.app/`

# Using the app

You can either import a data file or simply generate data in the browser, which is faster.

To zoom in or out, use the buttons in the top right.
To browse the selected data, click the time series scrollbar above the displayed data.
